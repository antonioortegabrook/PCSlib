# PCSlib for Max
A set of externals for Pitch-Class Sets and Combinatorial Matrices analysis and transformation.
PCSlib for Max is mostly a port from PCSLIB for Pure Data, although it has some minor differences (which will be documented later in more detail).

PCSLIB was originally developed by Pablo Di Liscia and Pablo Cetta for the Pure Data environment. More info can be found [here](https://puredata.info/Members/pdiliscia/pcslib).

### Running
Should run on MacOS 10.7 or later and Max 6 or 7 in 32 & 64 bit. However it has only been tested in Max 7 & MacOS 10.11.

### Building
In order to build PCSlib for Max, the Max SDK must be properly installed. Normally you would create the ‘PCSlib’ folder in ‘~/Documents/Max 7/Packages/max-sdk-7.1.0/source’ and clone this repository into it.
The Max SDK and its documentation can be downloaded from [www.cycling74.com](https://cycling74.com/downloads/sdk/#.WJy7LRiZPpA).
